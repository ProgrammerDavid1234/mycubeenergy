            question: "How does MyCubeEnergyâ€™s pay-as-you-go model work?",
            answer: "Our pay-as-you-go model allows you to purchase electricity credits based on your needs and budget. You can easily top up your account through our online platform or mobile app. As you use electricity, the smart meter deducts the corresponding amount from your credits. This model ensures transparency and flexibility, so you only pay for the electricity you consume."
